## Project 1 - Twitter Scraping Analysis

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rtlaceste/Pages/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

One fun idea I had one day was to analyze the tweets of the president-elect to see if an algorithm would be able to guess if his tweets carried a positive, negative, or neutral connotation. 

### Markdown

Cleaning up the data

```python
Syntax highlighted code block

def cleanTxt(text):
    text = re.sub(r'@[A-Za-z0-9]+', "", text) #Removes @mentions
    text = re.sub(r"#", '', text)
    text = re.sub(r"RT[\s]+", '', text)
    text = re.sub(r"https?:\/\/\S+", "", text)
    
    return text
